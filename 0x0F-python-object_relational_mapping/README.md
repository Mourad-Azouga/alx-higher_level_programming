# Object-relational mapping
## by AZOUGA Mourad
This repo is made for the project: 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping
It contains two types of files: .sql that have the sql code and .py with the python code
The goal is to use SQLAlchemy as an ORM so that we can use the python code instead of SQl to manipulate the database
